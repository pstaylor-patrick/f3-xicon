ai_guidelines: always use functional components, prefer hooks over classes, use type-safe code, follow PRD requirements, use the latest version of the libraries and frameworks (e.g., react 19 / next 15 server actions and server components)

security: never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials

performance: always optimize for performance, use the latest version of the libraries and frameworks

accessibility: always follow accessibility guidelines, use the latest version of the libraries and frameworks

best_practices: always follow best practices, use the latest version of the libraries and frameworks

documentation: always follow documentation guidelines, use the latest version of the libraries and frameworks

when writing test coverage, I prefer to have the files alongside the code rather than in a separate tests directory. For example:
- `/Button.tsx`
- `/Button.test.tsx`
